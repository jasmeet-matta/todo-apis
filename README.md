## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of APIs designed to facilitate task and todo management. With these APIs, you can create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## Getting Started

To use the APIs locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `npm start`.

Now you're ready to interact with the APIs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- Express.js: A lightweight web application framework.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- Body-parser: Middleware for parsing request bodies.

For a full list of dependencies, check the [package.json](./package.json) file.

## Database Connection

The [mongoConnection.js](./mongoConnection.js) file contains the code for establishing a connection to the MongoDB database. Make sure to update the database URL and credentials as needed.

## API Endpoints

The main API routes and their functionality are detailed in the [api.js](./api.js) file. These endpoints allow you to interact with tasks and todos, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them.

Here are some example endpoints:

- GET `/api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
- POST `/api/tasks`: Create a new task.
- PUT `/api/tasks/:id`: Update a task by ID.
- DELETE `/api/tasks/:id`: Delete a task by ID.

For more detailed information, refer to the [api.js](./api.js) file.
